# This is a solution for BA-Challenge 2019 part 2

Done by Viktorija Kondratjevaite during 11.22 - 11.26 and will not be improved until the deadline due to a personal vacation. 🏖️

## Project setup 🧾

In project directory run `npm install` and then `npm start`.

## Things accomplished ✔️

- Created `index.html` file with CSS styling and FeedbackInput form.
- It can be accessed after running Node and navigating to localhost:3211 (But it's missing CSS)

## Things to improve ⚙️

- Make the button in HTML call Javascript function and send the feedback form's values to create a feedback Object (containing of name, email, date and comment).
- Make HTML display on the correct port and with the CSS.
- Try to recreate same application with React 😊 It looks very fun.
- Overall research more about Node.js and React. Ran out of time on this task.
